    <p>1. Provides Stability</p>
Education provides stability in life, and itâ€™s something that no one can ever take away from you. By being well-educated and holding a college degree, you increase your chances for better career opportunities and open up new doors for yourself.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2 align= "center" ; hspace=10  ; style="font-size: 21px ; font-weight:normal ; margin:0px ; background:none ; line-height:1.5em ;">
   <p>2. Confidence</p>
Being self-confident is a major part of being successful in life. And what better way to gain that confidence than with an education? Your level of education is often considered a way to prove your knowledge, and it can give you the confidence to express your opinions and speak your mind.</h2> 
    <br>
    <h2 align= "center" ; hspace=10  ; style="font-size: 21px ; font-weight:normal ; margin:0px ; background:none ; line-height:1.5em ;">
   <p>3.  Independence</p>
With an education, you can build a career that gives you financial independence. When your education qualifies you for work that pays well enough to cover a place to live and other necessities, you become independent. You are no longer tethered financially to your parents or guardians.

The financial independence that comes from your education can also give you the freedom to experience the continuing benefits of learning and growing your skills throughout your life. Further education may prepare you professionally for more interesting or financially rewarding career options.</h2>
